# Discord Bot

A basic discord bot made using discord.js, a node.js module which makes it easier to interact the Discord API.

The main functionality is being able to display certain messages based on commands, with a couple responses from the bot that are randomly generated.

The main featured commands are the commands that pull from the large data object displayed at the top of index.js. The object contains varying amounts of frame data taken from a video game called Super Smash Brothers Melee. The data is transformed into a nice embed message, containing the data and a .gif image of the specified move, like so:

Although the data only contains information for the character Fox, I may include more or all characters later.

The tempmute.js file is currently non-functioning, but I plan on making some adjustments to figure it out. The goal of it was to be able to mute certain discord users in the server with a simple command.
